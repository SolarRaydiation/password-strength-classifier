# Machine-Learning Based Password Strength Evaluator
A simple Python-based machine learning application that allows a quick and easy way to determine the strength of a password through machine learning.

## Project Features
The application revolves around one feature only - to provide a simple way to classify password strength via a GUI. Password strength classification is performed by a machine learning model, which was trained on approximately 670,000 passwords of varying password strengths. The machine learning algorithm used was the K Nearest Neighbors found in the `sklearn.neighbors` module from [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html). Although the machine learning model has finished training, development of the GUI has yet to begin.

## Installation and Running the Project
There is no installation procedure yet. However, those familiar with Jupyter Notebooks can run the model. Please see the notebook entitled 'model' found in this repo.

## Future Features
This project is planned to have a GUI built using Python's built-in `Tkinter` module. The library `CustomTkinter` may be included to give the planned GUI a modern feel.
